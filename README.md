# Overview

Welcome to the Air Quality Prediction Challenge!
This competition focuses on assessing and predicting air quality across various regions. Using a dataset of 5,000 samples, which includes key environmental and demographic factors influencing pollution levels, your task is to develop a predictive model.
The goal is to accurately forecast air quality levels, enabling better resource allocation and proactive measures in regions likely to experience pollution issues. 

# Description

In this challenge, participants are tasked with developing a predictive model to forecast air quality levels and identify regions at risk of poor or hazardous conditions. With increasing concerns about air pollution and limited resources for monitoring and intervention, the goal is to prioritize resource allocation and target regions requiring immediate action.
By tackling this critical issue, you will contribute to optimizing air quality assessment and management, supporting better environmental health and sustainability. This challenge is a chance to demonstrate your machine learning and data analysis expertise while making a meaningful impact on public health and the environment. 

# Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on accuracy between the predicted air quality levels and the observed target.
